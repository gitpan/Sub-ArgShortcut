Sub-ArgShortcut version 1.0

This module encapsulates the logic required for functions that use default
arguments, as many core Perl functions do. You only need to write code which
modifies the elements of @_ in-place. This module will then layer the following
two behaviours on top of your code:

* If no arguments are given, the function will use C<$_> as its input.
* If no return value is expected, it will modify its arguments in-place.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
